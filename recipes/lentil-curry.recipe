4 tbsp mild curry powder
0.5 tbsp light brown sugar
1 tsp salt
0.75 tsp ground tumeric
0.25 tsp cayenne pepper
250 ml water

Rince the lentils in a little water and allow to soak whilst you continue with the recipe.

Set the instant pot to saute and soften the onion in the coconut oil and 1 tbsp water (a couple of minutes).

Measure the ginger, garlic, curry powder, sugar, salt, tumeric and cayenne pepper into a bowl. Add these spices to the instant pot and stir well.

Add the water, lentils and cocounut milk to the instant pot and stir to make sure everything is well mixed. Sometimes the coconut milk I buy has separated in the tin and is a little tricky to get out - when it's in the pot it will recombine as you mix it for a few minutes. If you use light coconut milk you won't have this problem.

Close the instant pot and set to cook on high pressure for 15 minutes. It will take about 10 minutes to get to high pressure. Whilst you wait for this, weigh the rice and rince it well (until the water is almost clear). Put the rice in a rice cooker with an appropriate amount of water, and when the instant pot beeps to say it's at pressure turn on the rice cooker (this way the rice will be ready when the curry is).

When the instant pot finishes it's 15 minute pressure cook, allow it to slow release (ie don't touch it) for 10 minutes.

Now release the pressure with the valve on top. Mix in the lemon juice when it's safe to open the lid. The rice should also be about done now.

Serve the curry over the rice with some chopped coriander sprinkled on top.
