Ingredient list
6 oz Unsalted Flora Plant Butter (https://www.flora.com/en-us/floraplant/our-products/unsalted-plant-butter), softened slightly but not melted or spreadable
4 oz Castor Sugar
9 oz Gluten Free Flour (https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/250304402)
1 tbsp Baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
4 oz Extra Dark Cooking Chocolate (https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/273714325)
A little flaked sea salt, for topping

=====
Turn your oven to 170C (fan)

Mix the sugar and butter together with a wooden spatula until well combined, do not overwork to a cream.

With the wooden spoon mix in 4oz of the flour, the baking powder and the salt

Now with your hands combine the remaining flour and the chocolate into the bix and bring it together to a combined cookie dough ball. Make sure it is well combined, but 
try to avoid overworking it as warming the butter too much can make it trickier to shape.

Divide the ball into 18 equal portions. Form cookies by rolling each portion into a ball in your palm, then press it about 1 cm flat and place it on a greaseproof lined
baking tray.

Bake for 13 minutes (or until starting to brown around the edges). Allow to cool in the tray for at least 10 minutes before carefully moving to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
